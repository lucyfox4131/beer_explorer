        but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired
        by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep,
        rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat
        Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish \u2013 with its own rich
        heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we\u2019re big fans of
        small batches, here\u2019s to the currently threatened Cutthroat population
