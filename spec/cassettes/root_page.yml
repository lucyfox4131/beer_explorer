        style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have
        a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and
        fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness
        and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very
        high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this
        style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and\/or toffee
        aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation,
        such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and\/or flavors, are not generally
        acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced
        oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can
        be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"60","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"8.4","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"22","ogMin":"1.09","fgMin":"1.024","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21
