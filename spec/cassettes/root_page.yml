        pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for
        a beer of its alcoholic strength. Often brewed with light colored Belgian
        \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness
        is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range.
        These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic
        character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity
        of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex
        fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are
        sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic
        spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable
        at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21
